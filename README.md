## Looking for a resource that was once housed in training-kit?

This repository currently contains Git and GitHub cheat sheets. If you're looking for a project that used to be housed here, such as On-Demand training, reading lists, videos, and book recommendations, see [this commit](https://github.com/github/training-kit/tree/4fbf180e980ef973ba4cc4b8ef3d5f278ddc8c08) in the repository's history.

## Projects used in training-kit

- We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- Our content is styled using the [Primer CSS toolkit](https://github.com/primer/primer-css).

## Packaging for viewing behind your firewall

If you'd like to have a copy of the files to be served from a web server inside your firewall, start by running `script/package`.

1. Run `script/package` to create a release tarball. This will be in the format `release-XXXXXXX.tgz` for you to take wherever you want.
2. To test this looks okay, create some folders `mkdir -p test_site/kit`.
3. Extract the release, `tar -xzf release-XXXXXXX.tgz -C test_site/kit`.
4. Switch into the test_site directory, `cd test_site`.
5. View the site:
    - For python version 2.x, run: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
    - For python version 3.x, run: `python -m http.server`
    - _Note: Some servers are more advanced than others and can handle redirects, smart recognition of `.html` files, etc_
